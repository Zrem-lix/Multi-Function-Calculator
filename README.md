# Multi-Function Calculator

A simple command-line application for calculating areas of geometric figures, converting units (pressure and wind speed), and converting hexadecimal numbers to decimal. This project provides a basic menu-driven interface to perform these calculations.

## Features

- **Area Calculations**: Compute the area of squares, rectangles, circles, and triangles.
- **Units Conversion**: Convert between different units of pressure and wind speed.
- **Base Conversion**: Convert hexadecimal numbers to decimal.

## Usage

1. **Area Calculations**:
   - Choose the shape (square, rectangle, circle, triangle).
   - Enter the dimensions to calculate the area.
   - Optionally, check how many small figures fit into the calculated area.

2. **Units Conversion**:
   - Choose the type of unit to convert (pressure or wind speed).
   - Select the original unit and enter the value.
   - The program will display the converted values.

3. **Base Conversion**:
   - Enter a hexadecimal number to get its decimal equivalent.
